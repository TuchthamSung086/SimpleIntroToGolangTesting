There are READMEs in each folder that represent levels of testing in golang.

This repository does not teach testing theory, but how we do it in golang with very simple examples.

My goal is to give you very broad ideas, so that at least you know what is what while reading random forums on the internet.

I don't like to read walls of text, so I designed this to be a quick and dirty intro.

Huge thanks to Mr. Siraphob K. for the great learning resources.
